    <h1>Welcome Home Suckers!</h1>
    <p>Okay, this is where I'll be talking about my journey in the <b>yes-code</b> world. It'll be full of <i>attributed</i> adventures and <i>tagged</i> fun. <br> <br> Who's excited?? </br> </br>
First, let's start with the work I've done so far. Today, I'm a writer of some repute, but my journey to the world of words began over over two years ago. I'd stumbled on a BellaNaija ad asking for stories from tribes other than the <b> <i> Big Three. </i> </b> And decided to rep my people, <a href="https://www.bellanaija.com/2018/08/beyond-three-nhaoma-takes-south-sourth-meet-the-ikwerres-river-state/">the Ikwerres.</a> <br> </br>
